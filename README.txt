ABOUT
---------------------------------------------------
This was a game I created for the Hunt the Wumpus 2016.
Hunt the Wumpus is a game making contest hosted by Microsoft, and the
alumini competition basically allows for any game to be created (no
spec to follow). The competition is between teams of high schoolers.
I did all the programming, art, and animations, and had a friend (Kyle
Haining) write the music. The game was created using Unity (programming),
Bosca Ceoil (music), and Piskel (art). The game recieved runner up.

To run the game, double click "shootFaster1.4.exe". I know there's a bunch
of files in there, but I'm too scared of breaking something if I move
too many files, because Unity is oh so confusing. 


HOW TO PLAY
-----------------------------------------------------
The game is a basic shoot 'em up. You're the stick figure guy with a Fedora. 
Protect your cute lil' cows (man I'm proud of their sprites).

Use WASD to move
Space to jump
Click to shoot the UFOs
Press Enter to enter/exit buildings (only gun shop and hospital work)
